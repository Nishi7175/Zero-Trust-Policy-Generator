# Zero-Trust-Policy-Generator
Overview
The Zero Trust Policy Generator is a cybersecurity platform that analyzes network logs, detects behavioral anomalies, and generates adaptive zero trust security policies. This tool implements the core principle of "never trust, always verify" through behavioral analysis and real-time threat correlation.

Advanced Configuration
Behavioral Analysis Tuning
javascript// Customize behavioral thresholds
behavioralThresholds: {
    anomalyDetection: 0.7,        // Anomaly detection sensitivity
    trustDecay: 0.1,              // Trust score decay rate
    baselineWindow: "7d",         // Learning period
    adaptationRate: 0.05          // Adaptation speed
}
Threat Intelligence Settings
javascript// Configure threat detection
threatSettings: {
    severityThreshold: "medium",   // Minimum threat level
    realTimeCorrelation: true,     // Enable real-time TI feeds
    honeypotIntegration: true,     // Monitor honeypot interactions
    iocRetention: "30d"           // Indicator retention period
}

Security Considerations
Data Privacy

All log analysis is performed locally in the browser
No sensitive data is transmitted to external servers
User behavioral profiles are stored temporarily only
Full data deletion upon session termination

Access Control

Role-based access to policy management functions
Audit logging of all policy changes and approvals
Multi-factor authentication integration ready
Principle of least privilege enforcement

Compliance

GDPR: Data minimization and right to be forgotten
SOX: Financial data access controls and audit trails
HIPAA: Healthcare information protection measures
PCI DSS: Payment card industry security standards


Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Analysis Not Starting
Issue: Analysis button remains disabled
Solution: 
1. Ensure network logs contain required fields
2. Verify minimum 100 log entries
3. Check log format matches Zeek/Bro standard
4. Clear browser cache and reload
Low Confidence Scores
Issue: Generated policies show low confidence
Solution:
1. Increase log dataset size (recommended 1000+ entries)
2. Ensure logs span longer time period (24+ hours)
3. Verify log quality and completeness
4. Review behavioral baseline requirements
Missing Trust Relationships
Issue: No users appear in trust matrix
Solution:
1. Verify user field format in logs
2. Check for successful authentication events
3. Ensure resource access patterns exist
4. Review log parsing configuration
Performance Optimization
Large Log Processing

Batch Processing: Split large log files into smaller chunks
Memory Management: Close unused browser tabs during analysis
Progressive Loading: Use sample data first to verify configuration

Browser Optimization

Chrome: Start Chrome with increased memory allocation by launching from command line:
bashchrome --max-old-space-size=8192
# or on Linux/Mac:
google-chrome --max-old-space-size=8192
Alternatively, modify your Chrome desktop shortcut to include this flag
Firefox: Enable hardware acceleration in Settings > General > Performance
Safari: Clear browser cache before large analyses (Safari > Develop > Empty Caches)
